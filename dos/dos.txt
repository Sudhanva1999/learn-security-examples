- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
Vulnerability Explanation:
The vulnerability lies in the insecure handling of user input in the route 
to authenticate users. Specifically, in the insecure file, the code directly 
uses the user-provided value (`id`) in the query to find a user in the database.
 This makes the application susceptible to NoSQL injection attacks, where 
 an attacker can manipulate the query to extract sensitive information 
 or perform unauthorized actions on the database.

Secure Version Prevention:
In the secure version, the vulnerability is mitigated by implementing 
proper error handling using try-catch blocks. Instead of executing 
the query directly with user input, the code attempts to execute the 
query within a try block. If an error occurs during the execution 
(indicating a potential attack or malformed input), it's caught in
 the catch block, and a generic error response is sent back to the 
 client. This prevents the attacker from exploiting the vulnerability 
 to extract data or compromise the system.


Additional Security Mechanisms:
1. Input Validation: Implement strict input validation to ensure that 
user-supplied values meet expected criteria. For instance, validate 
the format and type of the `id` parameter to ensure it's a valid 
MongoDB ObjectId.
2. Sanitization: Sanitize user input by removing or escaping any 
potentially dangerous characters or sequences before using them 
in database queries.
3. Parameterized Queries: Instead of directly embedding user input 
in queries, use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided
 by the database library. This separates the query logic from the data,
  preventing injection attacks.
4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement RBAC to restrict users'
 access to sensitive data and operations based on their roles and 
 permissions.
5. Logging and Monitoring: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
 mechanisms to detect and respond to suspicious activities, including
  potential injection attempts.
6. Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits and code 
reviews to identify and address vulnerabilities in the application codebase.
