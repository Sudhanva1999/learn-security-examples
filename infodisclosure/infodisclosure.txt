Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

1. Vulnerability:
   - In the insecure version, the code directly uses the user-provided `username` 
   value in the MongoDB query without any validation or sanitization, making it 
   vulnerable to NoSQL injection attacks.
   - Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious input that 
   alters the logic of the MongoDB query, potentially allowing unauthorized access 
   to sensitive data or even compromising the entire database.

2. Secure Solution:
   - The secure version mitigates this vulnerability by incorporating input 
   validation and sanitization measures.
   - It validates the `username` input to ensure it is of string type and then
    sanitizes it by removing any non-alphanumeric characters using a regular 
    expression.
   - This sanitized `username` is then used in the MongoDB query, preventing
    NoSQL injection attacks as the query logic remains intact.

3. Prevention of Vulnerability:
   - By validating and sanitizing the user input before using it in the database 
   query, the secure version prevents attackers from manipulating the query logic.
   - This ensures that only intended database records are retrieved based on 
   the sanitized input, mitigating the risk of unauthorized data access.

4. CIA Property Violation:
   - Tampering with the MongoDB query logic due to NoSQL injection vulnerabilities
    violates the Integrity property of the CIA triad.
   - It compromises the integrity of the data by allowing unauthorized modifications
    to the database query, potentially leading to unauthorized access or disclosure 
    of sensitive information.

5. Additional Security Mechanisms:
   - Using parameterized queries or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) libraries that
    automatically handle input sanitization can provide an extra layer of protection
     against injection attacks.
   - Employing authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only 
   authenticated and authorized users can access sensitive data.
   - Implementing rate limiting, request throttling, and logging mechanisms 
   to detect and mitigate suspicious activities or attacks.
   - Regularly updating dependencies, including frameworks, libraries, and
    database systems, to patch any known security vulnerabilities.
